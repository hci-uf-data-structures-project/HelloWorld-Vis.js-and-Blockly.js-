# HelloWorldFor-Vis.js-and-Blockly.js-

When you start from this page, you need to do:
1. create your own branch with your name. (locally)
2. change to that branch. (locally)
3. copy your code into that branch. (locally)
4. push. (push to online)

this repo should have 4 branches with our name that conain a simple hello world webpage by using Vis.js and Blockly.js.

I suggest to finish it before our Saturday meeting. However, finish the literature review first, that is more important.
